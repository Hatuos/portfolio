# Portfolio

## Getting Started

I`m developing this portfolio as a personal Angular proyect. **At the moment it is under development**, taking it as an opportunity to test things with Angular 19 as the framework is bringing many new features.

## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read)

The inspiration for the design and theme of this project is not purely mine, I consider it fair to give credit to the projects from which I have taken some ideas.

- [Rinkaswiftie Portfolio](https://github.com/Rinkaswiftie/DeveloperPortfolio)

- [saadpasta Portfolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio)

- [andresjosehr Portfolio](https://github.com/andresjosehr/andresjosehr-portfolio/tree/master)

If anyone wishes to use this code for themselves or make improvements to the project, they are welcome to do so. I only ask that, if the project is reused, credit be given to the source(s) from which it came.

As you all know, **plagiarism is bad**. It's always disheartening to find out that someone has copied your project without giving you any credit. **As I have made an attribution to others, I hope you will do the same with this and all projects that offer you a base of ideas.**
